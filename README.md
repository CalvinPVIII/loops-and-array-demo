### Arrays and Loops demo

This is the code for a brief demonstration on building a word analyzer. There are many ways you can solve this problem, and in this example I am solving it using key values pairs, as well as using just arrays. I have provided some comments on key lines of the code, but if you'd like further clarification then definitely reach out.
